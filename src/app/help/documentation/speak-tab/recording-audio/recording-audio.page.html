    <span class="red">[1]</span> The <span class="green_bar_right">green bar</span> indicates,
    that sentences 1-4 are already recorded.
    For <span style="border-right: 3px solid blue; padding-right: 5px">blue marked sentences</span> no audio
    exists.<br>
    <span class="red">[2]</span> The currently active sentence is <span class="bold">highlighted</span>.<br>
    <span class="red">[3]</span>&nbsp;<span class="blue_underline">The bar</span> above the recording buttons
    shows the progress of the
    whole text.<br>
    <span class="red">[4]</span> Use these buttons
    <ion-icon name="arrow-back" class="arrow-back-icon fill"></ion-icon>&nbsp;
    <ion-icon name="arrow-forward" class="arrow-forward-icon fill"></ion-icon>
    to select another sentence.
    Only sentences which are already recorded or the currently active can be selected.
    The selection is as well possible by clicking the sentence.<br>
    <span class="red">[5]</span> The microphone button <ion-icon name="mic" class="mic-icon fill"></ion-icon>

    In the scenario in Figure 6 the microphone button <ion-icon name="mic" class="mic-icon fill"></ion-icon> was
    clicked.<br>
    Now we are recording the sixth sentence <span class="red">[4]</span><br>
    This is being indicated by the blinking square button <ion-icon name="square" class="mic-icon-recording fill">
    </ion-icon><span class="red">[1]</span>
    which replaced the microphone button <ion-icon name="mic" class="mic-icon fill"></ion-icon>.<br>
    After you finished reading out the sentence you can press
    <ion-icon name="square" class="mic-icon-recording fill"></ion-icon> or
    <ion-icon name="arrow-forward" class="arrow-forward-icon fill"></ion-icon>.
    If you press <ion-icon name="square" class="mic-icon-recording fill"></ion-icon> the current
    recording is saved and then the recording is paused automatically (Figure 5).<br>
    If you press <ion-icon name="arrow-forward" class="arrow-forward-icon fill"></ion-icon> instead your current
    recording is saved and the recording of the
    next sentence starts
    immediately.<br>
    Having made a big mistake or made a long pause you can delete your current recording with the trashcan
    button <ion-icon name="trash" class="trash-icon fill"></ion-icon>.<br>
    The recording is paused automatically (Figure 5).

    When the recording is paused it is also possible to relisten recorded sentences.<br>
    Select the sentence you want to listen to and press the play button <ion-icon name="play" class="play-icon fill">
    </ion-icon>&nbsp;<span class="red">[1]</span><br>
    The recorded audio will be played.<br>
    If you want to correct the listened sentence you can rerecord the whole sentence.<br>
    For rerecording press the microphone button <ion-icon name="mic" class="mic-icon fill"></ion-icon>&nbsp;<span
      class="red">[2]</span> and the rerecording will start directly.
