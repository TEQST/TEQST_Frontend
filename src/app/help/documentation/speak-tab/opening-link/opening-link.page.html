    When you click on a link that has been shared with you,
    the folder will be opened inside TEQST.
    If you are not logged in or do not have an account yet,
    you can still proceed and will be redirected after logging in or registering.
    After clicking the link and logging in it will be added to your recent folders in the speak tab.

    After you have selected a folder you can see the texts within the folder.
    (<span class="red">[1]</span> in Figure 3)<br>
    Now you can choose a text, for collecting audio data, by clicking the name of the text.<br>
    If you open a text the first time you have to give the permission,
    to use your collected audio data, whether for text-to-speech, speech-recognition or both.<br>
    If you are interested in the recording time for this folder, click the alarm clock
    <ion-icon name="alarm" color="primary"></ion-icon> (<span class="red">[2]</span> in Figure 3).
