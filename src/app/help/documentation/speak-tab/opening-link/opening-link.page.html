  <h3>Opening a link to a shared folder</h3>
  <p>
    When you click on a link that has been shared with you,
    the folder will be opened inside TEQST.<br>
    If you are not logged in or do not have an account yet,
    you can still proceed and will be redirected after logging in or registering.<br>
    After clicking the link and logging in it will be added to your recent folders in the speak tab.

    After you have selected a folder you can see the texts within the folder
    <span class="red">[1]</span>.<br>
    Now you can choose a text, for collecting audio data, by clicking the name of the text.<br>
    If you open a text the first time you have to give the permission,
    to use your collected audio data, whether for text-to-speech, speech-recognition or both.<br>
    If you are interested in the recording time for this folder, click the alarm clock
    <ion-icon name="alarm" color="primary"></ion-icon> <span class="red"> [2]</span>.
