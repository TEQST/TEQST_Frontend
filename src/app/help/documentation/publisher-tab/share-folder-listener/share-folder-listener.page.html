    <h3>Sharing a folder with listeners</h3>
    <p>
        First navigate to the folder you would like to share.
        To permit a person to listen to the recording of others click on the ear symbol <ion-icon id="add-listener-icon"
            name="ear" color="dark"></ion-icon>.
        Existing listening permissions will be listed here.
        Now click on the blue plus button <ion-icon name="add" id="add-listening-icon"></ion-icon> to add a new
        listening permission.
        Here you can add one or multiple users by clicking the green plus button <ion-icon name="add"
            id="add-listening-user-icon"></ion-icon> next to their name.
        Then click on the next button.
        You can allow the listeners to listen to speakers either by certain accents or their usernames.
        This can be done by switching between the tabs "by accent" and "by username".
        Once you are done click the finish button to confirm your choices.
        After that the listeners will be able to listen to the shared folder.
