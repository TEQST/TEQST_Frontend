  <h4>Introduction: </h4>
  <p>This services agreement (“Agreement”) is an agreement between Datoid, LLC (“Datoid”, “us”, or “we”) and you to
    perform certain data collection tasks in exchange for payment as described herein.</p>
  <h4>The Parties: </h4>
  <p>Datoid is a limited liability company that performs scientific research and datacollection services in the realm of
    Interactive AI systems. Datoid seeks to gather data to help the improvement and development of better self-learning
    artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems. You are an individual or entity, offering to perform services to Datoid of
    your own volition. Both you and Datoid each have the right to terminate this relationship at any time. </p>
  <p>In exchange for payment from Datoid as outlined in the Payment Schedule, you agree as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h5>Services to be performed: </h5>
      <p>Datoid will provide you tasks via web-based application (“App”), email, or webpage. As part of the tasks, you
        will be asked to read or speak texts, record speech through the App, or label, transcribe or correct text,
        speech, images or videos or other means as instructed by Datoid. Datoid may apply AI technology that will
        recognize, process, convert or translate speech, language, image or video files using such data. These and other
        requests for writings, recordings, speech, correction, and clarification, constitute the “Tasks” for the purpose
        of this agreement. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Assignment of Rights: </h5>
      <p>
        You assign, in perpetuity, all rights and exclusive ownerships of data,
        recordings, writings, and any related materials produced through your performance of the
        Tasks (“Data”) to Datoid, its affiliates and assigns. You understand that Datoid, its affiliates
        and assigns, may -at its sole discretion- use the DATA in the development of proprietary AI
        systems, and or share such data with the research community. You explicitly relinquish any
        and all claims to future technology developments or improvements that Datoid, its affiliates
        or assigns, may make through the use of the Data. Should you obtain help from others in
        performing the data collection tasks, you hereby certify that all such assistance is included
        under this agreement and you hereby warrant that all assistants have also signed and
        agreed to the provisions in this agreement.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Indemnification: </h5>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless, Datoid, its affiliates and assigns
        from any legal proceedings in connection with your performance of the Tasks or gathering
        of the Data.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Binding Arbitration: </h5>
      <p>
        In the event that there is a legal dispute or claim relating to this
        Agreement, but specifically excluding any dispute principally related to Datoid’s intellectual
        property (which such dispute will be resolved in litigation before the United States District
        Court for the Western District of Washington), will be determined by arbitration in Seattle,
        Washington before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the
        <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">American Arbitration Association</a>
        under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
      </p>
    </li>
